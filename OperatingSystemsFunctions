At the startup menu, you can immediately access your most often used apps, documents and settings. Simply click once on the start up icon in the bottom left corner of your screen, and you'll see a convenient quick list of your most used apps, followed by an alphabetical list of your all your apps.
Pinning app icons to your task bar at the bottom of your screen allows immediate access to the apps you need to open quickly. While Windows used to have a less friendly user interface, and involved cumbersome layers to get to files and apps, Windows has come a long way and now makes navigating to your most needed files and apps extremely easy and intuitive.
